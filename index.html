                      have fallen under his sway. New and particularly effective
                      implements for magic works, they would become by
                      definition and without contest a part of his domain. …
                      Odin could have been the patron, the possessor par
                      excellence of this redoubtable power of secrecy and secret
                      knowledge, before the name of that knowledge became the
                      technical name of signs both phonetic and magic which came
                      from the Alps or elsewhere, but did not lose its former,

                <h4>What Is Norse mythology?</h4>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  Before the Norse (a.k.a. the Vikings) converted to
                  Christianity during the Middle Ages, they had their own
                  vibrant native pagan religion that was as harshly beautiful as
                  the Nordic landscape to which it was intimately connected. The
                  centerpiece of that religion was what we today call “Norse
                  mythology:” the set of religious stories that gave meaning to
                  the Vikings’ lives. These myths revolved around gods and
                  goddesses with fascinating and highly complex characters, such
                  as Odin, Thor, Freya, and Loki. <br /><br />
                  Religions are attempts by mankind to reach the numinous, and
                  the Norse religion was of course no exception. It provided a
                  means of doing this that was fitting for the Vikings’ time and
                  place. Even though some aspects of it may strike the modern
                  reader as bizarre, if we approach it with the open mind it
                  deserves, we can recognize within it the common human quest to
                  live life in the presence of the transcendent majesty and joy
                  of the sacred. And even though it’s been a thousand years
                  since the last Vikings laid down their swords, people today
                  continue to be inspired by the vitality and wonder of the
                  Norse myths and the gods who inhabit them.
                  <br /><br />
                  For the Vikings, the world as they found it was enchanted –
                  that is, they didn’t feel the need to seek salvation from the
                  world, but instead delighted in, and marveled at, “the way
                  things are,” including what we today would call both “nature”
                  and “culture.” Their religion and myths didn’t sugarcoat the
                  sordidness, strife, and unfairness of earthly life, but
                  instead acknowledged it and praised the attempt to master it
                  through the accomplishment of great deeds for the benefit of
                  oneself and one’s people. A life full of such deeds was what
                  “the good life” was for the Vikings.

                <h4>Who Were the Vikings?</h4>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  The Vikings were seafaring raiders, conquerors, explorers,
                  settlers, and traders from modern-day Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
                  and Iceland who ventured throughout much of the world during
                  the Viking Age (roughly 793-1066 CE). They traveled as far
                  east as Baghdad and as far west as North America, which they
                  discovered some five hundred years before Christopher
                  Columbus. They spoke the Old Norse language, wrote in runes,
                  and practiced their ancestral religion. <br /><br />
                  The Vikings were motivated to sail from their homelands by
                  timeless, universal human desires: wealth, prestige, and
                  power. As in most human societies, those aims were intertwined
                  for the Vikings; those who had more wealth typically had more
                  prestige and power, and vice versa. The Vikings sought wealth
                  in both its portable form – gold, silver, gemstones, and the
                  like – and in the form of land.
                  <br /><br />
                  We have the Vikings to thank for our present understanding not
                  only of their own pre-Christian religion and mythology, but of
                  that of the other Germanic peoples as well. Thanks to the Old
                  Norse poems, treatises, and sagas that were written during or
                  relatively soon after the Viking Age, we have a much, much
                  fuller picture of what the Vikings’ religion was like (despite
                  the many unfortunate holes that nevertheless remain in that
                  picture) than we do for the religions of any of the other
                  pre-Christian Germanic peoples. But from the little that we do
                  know about those religions directly, they seem to have been
                  variations on common themes that were also shared by the
                  Norse, so we can use the Norse sources to help us reconstruct
                  those hoary religions, too.

                <h4>Who Are the Germanic peoples?</h4>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  The Germanic peoples are one of the indigenous peoples of
                  northern Europe, along with the Celts, Sami, Finns, and
                  others. Historically, they’ve occupied much of Scandinavia,
                  Iceland, the British Isles, and continental Europe north of
                  the Alps. Their best-known representatives are the Vikings,
                  the Anglo-Saxons, and the continental Germanic tribes, but
                  they included many other groups as well. In the modern era,
                  they – we – are spread out across the world. <br /><br />
                  While there were certainly regional and temporal variations in
                  the pre-Christian religion of the Germanic peoples, there was
                  nevertheless a common core worldview, cosmology, and, to a
                  large extent, a common pantheon as well.
                  <br /><br />
                  If you’re a person of northern European descent (including
                  English, Scottish, German, and northern French descent), it’s
                  a safe bet that you’ve got some Germanic blood in you. That
                  means, in turn, that it’s a safe bet that some of your
                  ancestors practiced something very close to the religion
                  represented by Norse mythology.
                  <br /><br />
                  Of course, you very well may still find Norse/Germanic
                  mythology to be fascinating and illuminating if you don’t have
                  any Germanic in your ancestry. Mythologies are certainly
                  expressions of a particular person or people, but they’re far
                  from only that; there tends to be a spark of something more
                  timeless and universal in them as well.

                <h4>Introducing an instant classic - Norse Mythology</h4>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  Neil Gaiman has long been inspired by ancient mythology in
                  creating the fantastical realms of his fiction. Now he turns
                  his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura
                  rendition of the great northern tales. In Norse Mythology,
                  Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that
                  begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves
                  into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and
                  culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the
                  rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the
                  myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the
                  high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly
                  strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of a
                  giant, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From
                  Gaiman's deft and witty prose emerge the gods with their
                  fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being
                  duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion
                  ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe
                  pungent life again.

                <i>
                  “On the crest of a hill, under an inky black sky, Valhalla
                  stands in all her splendour. Spears hold up a roof made from
                  battle-worn shields. They're scratched and gouged, blood
                  glistening in nicks and groves. Magic makes the impossible,
                  possible. The Hall of the Slain. Gloriously strange and
                  macabre.” ― Michelle Connor, Where Ravens Soar
